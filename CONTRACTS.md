Gotta figure out nicknames and shit.

Perhaps a player_name (nickname) display would be fitting.

Backend -> Frontend

- [ ] connect_to_server (replace this with ping/pong & state of client?)
- [x] update_board
- [x] update_robots

- [x] switch_to_timer
- [x] clear_moves_queue
- [x] update_scoreboard
- [ ] update_user
- [x] update_chat --> player_chat_new_message // system_chat_new_message
- [ ] tick
- [x] new_game (fe needed)
- [ ] end_game/finish_round (fe needed)
- [ ] new_round (fe needed)
